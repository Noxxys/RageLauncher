# Rage Launcher

This small console tool is meant for people who are modding Red Dead Redemption 2, but who want to keep their game folder clean after their game session.

One reason for this might be the fear of being banned because the online component of the game detected mod files. this already happened to me in GTA V.

This tool moves your mod files to your game folder, launches Rage Plugin Hook, and then moves your mod files back to where they were after the game exists, living your game folder clean. It has been made and tested on Red Dead Redemption 2 with the Rockstar Launcher, but it should also work with other platforms such as Steam, or with GTA V.

## Installation

Download the latest release from ... and extract the zip archive to a folder of your choice. Do not launch any file from the zip archive.

## Configuration

Edit the config.json file with a text editor and modify the source path (containing your mod files) and the target path (containing your game). Follow the comments in that file for more information.

## Start

Double-click RageLauncher.exe and wait for the game to launch. You can make a shortcut to this file on your desktop, for easy access.
